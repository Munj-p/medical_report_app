The login.py module implements a simple authentication system for the medical report application using Flask. It allows users to securely log in with their email and password, manage sessions, and handle logouts. The module checks user credentials against a predefined set of users, and session data is maintained for active users. This system ensures that only authenticated users can access the dashboard and interact with reports.
The repository includes several templates and CSS files that handle the presentation and user interface of the application. The templates, written in HTML, utilize Jinja2 syntax to dynamically render content based on user input or session data. The CSS ensures that the site has a clean and responsive design
